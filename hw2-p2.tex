\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Show that the problem of minimizing energy
  $$
  I[u] = \int_J x^2 |u(x)|^2 \dx
  $$
  for $u \in C(\closure{J})$ with piecewise continuous derivatives in $J := (-1, 1)$, satisfying the boundary conditions $u(-1) = 0$, $u(1) = 1$ is not attained.
\item
  Consider the problem of minimizing the energy
  $$
  I[u] = \int_0^1 (1 + |u'(x)|^2)^{\frac{1}{4}} \dx
  $$
  for all $u \in C^1((0, 1)) \cap C([0, 1])$ satisfying $u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1$. Show that the minimum is $1$ and is not attained.
